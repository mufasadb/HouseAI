# Fish Speech Training on Sonnet 29 - Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

Successfully implemented Fish Speech training infrastructure for the HouseAI project, specifically targeting voice cloning using Shakespeare's Sonnet 29 audio recording.

## 📊 What Was Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Training Infrastructure Created
- **File**: `fish_speech_trainer.py`
- **Features**: Complete Fish Speech training pipeline with audio preprocessing, dataset creation, and training orchestration
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing ai-lego-bricks TTS framework

### 2. ✅ Audio Data Processed
- **Source**: `sonnet29.mp3` (65.39 seconds of audio)
- **Output**: 25 audio segments ranging from 0.51s to 3.04s
- **Processing**: Automatic silence detection and segmentation
- **Quality**: 44.1kHz sample rate, normalized audio

### 3. ✅ Training Dataset Created
- **Location**: `fish_speech_training/sonnet29/`
- **Manifest**: 25 text-audio pairs in JSONL format
- **Text Source**: Shakespeare's Sonnet 29 full text
- **Speaker ID**: "sonnet29" for voice identification

### 4. ✅ Training Configuration
- **Config File**: `training_config.json`
- **Model**: Fish Speech S1 architecture
- **Parameters**: 100 epochs, batch size 8, learning rate 1e-4
- **Audio Settings**: 44.1kHz sample rate, duration limits 0.5s-10s

### 5. ✅ Integration Ready
- **TTS Integration**: Compatible with existing `custom_tts.py`
- **Agent Integration**: Ready for ai-lego-bricks agent orchestration
- **Voice Selection**: Can be used as "custom_voice" in TTS calls

## 🎵 Audio Processing Results

- **Total Duration**: 65.39 seconds processed
- **Segments Created**: 25 individual audio files
- **Average Segment**: ~2.6 seconds
- **Quality**: All segments normalized and cleaned
- **Format**: WAV files at 44.1kHz

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Training Pipeline
1. **Audio Preprocessing**: Load, normalize, and segment audio
2. **Silence Detection**: Energy-based automatic segmentation
3. **Text Alignment**: Map text content to audio segments
4. **Manifest Creation**: JSONL format for training
5. **Configuration**: JSON-based training parameters

### Integration Points
- **TTS Service**: Uses existing `FishSpeechTTSClient`
- **Voice Selection**: "custom_voice" identifier
- **Agent System**: Compatible with JSON-driven workflows
- **API**: RESTful integration with Fish Speech server

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Python API
```python
from custom_tts import create_fish_speech_tts_service

tts_service = create_fish_speech_tts_service(voice="custom_voice")
response = tts_service.text_to_speech(
    text="When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes",
    voice="custom_voice"
)
```

### Agent Configuration
```json
{
  "name": "SonnetReadingAgent",
  "steps": [
    {
      "type": "tts",
      "provider": "fish_speech",
      "voice": "custom_voice",
      "text": "Poetry reading with Sonnet 29 voice"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 📋 Current Status
