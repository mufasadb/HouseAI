# AI Lego Bricks Streaming Feedback

## Current Implementation Status

We have successfully created a multi-agent routing system that:

1. **Routes queries** between Japanese tutor, Home Assistant, and General agents
2. **Uses enum-based routing** (JAPANESE, HOME_ASSISTANT, GENERAL) instead of confidence scores
3. **Supports streaming responses** from specialized agents
4. **Integrates with existing agent infrastructure**

## Streaming Requirements for AI Lego Bricks

During implementation, we identified several streaming-related needs for ai-lego-bricks:

### 1. Routing Agent Chain Streaming
**Current Challenge**: When routing between agents, we need the entire pipeline to maintain streaming:
- Router decision → Agent selection → Streamed response back to user

**What we need**: The orchestrator should support streaming through multi-step workflows where:
- Step 1 (routing) can be non-streaming (quick decision)
- Step 2 (agent execution) maintains streaming to end user
- No buffering between routing decision and agent response

### 2. Cross-Agent Streaming Context
**Current Challenge**: When one agent (router) hands off to another agent (specialized), streaming context should be preserved.

**What we need**: 
- Ability to pass streaming tokens directly from specialized agent to user
- No intermediate buffering that breaks real-time streaming experience
- Seamless handoff between agents in the same conversation flow

### 3. Error Handling in Streaming Chains
**Current Challenge**: When routing fails or target agent errors occur, streaming should gracefully fall back.

**What we need**:
- Fallback mechanisms that don't break streaming
- Error messages that can be streamed back to user
- Graceful degradation when one agent in the chain fails

### 4. Memory Management Across Routed Agents
**Current Challenge**: Each specialized agent needs to maintain conversation memory independently while the router coordinates.

**What we need**:
- Router should maintain high-level conversation context
- Specialized agents should maintain domain-specific memory
- Memory handoff when switching between agents mid-conversation

## Implementation Decisions Made

Due to the above streaming requirements, we implemented the router as a **Python coordinator** rather than pure JSON workflow:

### Why Python Implementation:
1. **Direct streaming control**: We can handle streaming responses directly without JSON workflow limitations
2. **Error handling**: Better exception handling and fallback logic
3. **Agent coordination**: More flexible agent switching and memory management
4. **Service injection**: Direct access to ai-lego-bricks services without workflow constraints

### JSON Files Created:
1. `routing_agent.json` - Pure routing decision logic (non-streaming)
2. `streaming_japanese_agent.json` - Specialized Japanese tutor (streaming)
3. `streaming_home_assistant_agent.json` - Smart home control (streaming + tools)
4. `basic_chat_agent.json` - General chat fallback

### Python Implementation:
- `run_routing_agent.py` - Main router with streaming coordination
- Handles service injection, agent selection, and streaming response coordination
- Provides both interactive and test modes

## Recommendations for AI Lego Bricks Enhancement

1. **Native Multi-Agent Workflows**: JSON workflows that can route between other JSON workflows with streaming preservation

2. **Streaming Chain Management**: Built-in support for streaming through multi-step agent chains

3. **Conditional Workflow Routing**: JSON-based routing that can dynamically select sub-workflows based on LLM decisions

4. **Cross-Workflow Memory**: Shared memory contexts that can be passed between different workflow executions

5. **Stream Multiplexing**: Ability to stream from multiple agents or merge streams from different sources

## Testing Status

- **Router Logic**: ✅ Successfully routes between agents based on query content
- **Agent Integration**: ✅ All specialized agents are properly integrated  
- **Streaming Support**: ⚠️ Limited testing due to offline Ollama server
- **End-to-End Flow**: ⚠️ Needs live server testing for full validation

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `routing_agent.json` - Router decision logic
- `run_routing_agent.py` - Python router implementation  
- `ai_lego_bricks_streaming_feedback.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
- `test_agents.sh` - Added option 3 for smart router + option 4 for testing all agents

The implementation provides a working multi-agent routing system with streaming support, though some advanced streaming features would benefit from enhanced ai-lego-bricks capabilities.
